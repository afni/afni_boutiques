The first subbrick is for Delay. The second subbrick is for Covariance, which is an estimate of the power in voxel time series at the frequencies present in the reference time series. The third subbrick is for the Cross Correlation Coefficients between FMRI time series and reference time series. The fourth subbrick contains estimates of the Variance of voxel time series. The default prefix is the prefix of the input dset with a '.DEL' extension appended to it.  [-polort order]    Detrend input time series with polynomial of order 'order'. If you use -1 for order then the program will suggest an order for you (about 1 for each 150 seconds) The minimum recommended is 1. The default is -1 for auto selection. This is the same as option Nort in the plugin version. [-nodtrnd]         Equivalent to polort 0, whereby only the mean is removed. NOTE:   Regardless of these detrending options, No detrending is done to the reference time series.  [-uS/-uD/-uR]      Units for delay estimates. (Seconds/Degrees/Radians) You can't use Degrees or Radians as units unless you specify a value for Tstim > 0. [-phzwrp]          Delay (or phase) wrap. This switch maps delays from: (Seconds) 0->T/2 to 0->T/2 and T/2->T to -T/2->0 (Degrees) 0->180 to 0->180 and 180->360 to -180->0 (Radians) 0->pi to 0->pi and pi->2pi to -pi->0 You can't use this option unless you specify a value for Tstim > 0. [-nophzwrp]        Do not wrap phase (default).

[-nfirst fnum]     fnum = number of first dataset image to use in the delay estimate. (default = 0) [-nlast  lnum]     lnum = number of last dataset image to use in the delay estimate. (default = last)  [-co CCT]          Cross Correlation Coefficient threshold value. This is only used to limit the ascii output (see below).  [-asc [out]]       Write the results to an ascii file for voxels with [-ascts [out]]     cross correlation coefficients larger than CCT.
