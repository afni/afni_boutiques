If ROI_LABELS is a dataset in niml format, then you need not use -roi_nodes because node indices are stored with the labels. Notice: With this option, an output is created for each label. The output contains two columns: One with node indices and one with the label. When this option is not used, you get one column out containing node indices only.  You can also use the key word PER_NODE (i.e. -roi_labels PER_NODE) to tell the program to consider each node to be a separate ROI. If you do not use the option -roi_nodes (see below), then each node forming the surface is considered to be an ROI on its own and a region will be grown around it accordingly. Under this scenario you would get as many files out as you have nodes in the surface. If you do specify the option -roi_nodes, then growth is done separately from each node index found in ROI_INDICES below. PER_NODE is likely to produce lots of files unless restricted to a few node indices. You could hide them by using a prefix beginning with '.', such as -prefix .HIDDEN_FILES  Example: ROIgrow -i ld20 -roi_labels PER_NODE -prefix toy -lim 10  #launch suma with: suma -i ld20 & #Visualize grown neighborhood around node 1484 for example.
