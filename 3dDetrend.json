If no -del option is ever given, then the TR given in the dataset header is used for 'ddd'; if that isn't available, then 'ddd'=1.0 is assumed.  The j-th time point will have independent variable = j * ddd, starting at j=0.  For example: -expr 'sin(x)' -del 2.0 -expr 'z**3' means that the stepsize in 'sin(x)' is delta-x=TR, but the stepsize in 'z**3' is delta-z = 2.  N.B.: expressions are NOT calculated on a per-slice basis when the -byslice option is used.  If you have to do this, you could compute vectors with the required time series using 1deval.  Detrending 1D files ------------------- As far as '3d' programs are concerned, you can input a 1D file as a 'dataset'.  Each row is a separate voxel, and each column is a separate time point.  If you want to detrend a single column, then you need to transpose it on input.  For example:  3dDetrend -prefix - -vector G1.1D -polort 3 G5.1D\\' | 1dplot -stdin  Note that the '-vector' file is NOT transposed with \\', but that the input dataset file IS transposed.  This is because in the first case the program expects a 1D file, and so knows that the column direction is time.  In the second case, the program expects a 3D dataset, and when given a 1D file, knows that the row direction is time -- so it must be transposed.  I'm sorry if this is confusing, but that's the way it is.  NOTE: to have the output file appear so that time is in the column direction, you'll have to add the option '-DAFNI_1D_TRANOUT=YES' to the command line, as in  3dDetrend -DAFNI_1D_TRANOUT=YES -prefix - -vector G1.1D -polort 3 G5.1D\\' > Q.1D   ++ Compile date = Sep  7 2018 {:}",
