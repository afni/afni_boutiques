No rotations are done. *Note that if you use -prefix, a new dataset will be created that is a copy of the anat, except that it's origin will be shifted and it will have a different ID code than the anat.  If you want to use this new dataset as the anatomy parent for the EPI datasets, you'll have to use 3drefit -apar ppp+orig eee1+orig eee2+orig ... *If no new dataset is written (no -prefix option), then you can use the 3drefit command emitted at the end to modify the origin of the anat dataset.  (Assuming you trust the results - visual inspection is recommended!) *The reason the default search grid is mostly along the EPI y-axis is that axis is usually the phase-encoding direction, which is most subject to displacement due to off-resonance effects. *Note that the time this program takes will be proportional to (2*nx+1)*(2*ny+1)*(2*nz+1), so using a very large search grid will result in a very large usage of CPU time. *Recommended usage: + Make a 1-brick function volume from a typical EPI dataset: 3dbucket -fbuc -prefix epi_fb epi+orig + Use 3dIntracranial to scalp a T1-weighted volume: 3dIntracranial -anat spgr+orig -prefix spgr_st + Use 3dAnatNudge to produce a shifted anat dataset 3dAnatNudge -anat spgr_st+orig -epi epi_fb+orig -prefix spgr_nudge + Start AFNI and look at epi_fb overlaid in color on the anat datasets spgr_st+orig and spgr_nudge+orig, to see if the nudged dataset seems like a better fit. + Delete the nudged dataset spgr_nudge. + If the nudged dataset DOES look better, then apply the 3drefit command output by 3dAnatNudge to spgr+orig. *Note that the x-, y-, and z-axes for the epi and anat datasets may point in different directions (e.g., axial SPGR and coronal EPI).  The 3drefit command applies to the anat dataset, NOT to the EPI dataset. *If the program runs successfully, the only thing set to stdout will be the 3drefit command string; all other messages go to stderr.  This can be useful if you want to capture the command to a shell variable and then execute it, as in the following csh fragment: set cvar = `3dAnatNudge ...` if( $cvar[1] == \"3drefit\" ) $cvar The test on the first sub-string in cvar allows for the possibility that the program fails, or that the optimal nudge is zero.  ++ Compile date = Sep  7 2018 {:}",
