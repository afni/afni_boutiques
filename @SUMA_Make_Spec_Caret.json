More help may be found at https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/ssc/ziad/SUMA/SUMA_doc.htm 1. Surface file names should look like the standard names used by Caret: Human.3dAnatomy.LR.Fiducial.2006-05-09.54773.coord Human.3dAnatomy.LR.CLOSED.2006-05-09.54773.topo Otherwise the script cannot detect them. You will need to decide which surface is the most recent (the best) and the script helps you by listing the available surfaces with the most recent one first. This sorting ususally works except when the time stamps on the surface files are messed up. In such a case you just need to know which one to use. Once the Fiducial surface is chosen, it's complimentary surfaces are selected using the node number in the file name. 3. You can tailor the script to your needs. Just make sure you rename it or risk having your modifications overwritten with the next SUMA version you install. 4. The script looks for Fiducial FIDUCIAL Raw RAW VeryInflated VERY-INFLATED VERY_INFLATED Inflated INFLATED surfaces, let us know if more need to be sought. 5. The test data I had contained .R. and .LR. surfaces! I am not sure what .LR. means since the surfaces are for one hemisphere but the script will use these surfaces too. 6. If you have reconstructed each hemisphere separately, follow these suggestions to keep your life simple. Assume Caret results are in Left_Hem/ and Right_Hem/ directories  mkdir LR_Hem cp -p Left_Hem/* Right_Hem/* LR_Hem cd LR_Hem @SUMA_Make_Spec_Caret -sid Joe and merge the two specs with: inspec -LRmege Joe_lh.spec Joe_rh.spec -prefix Joe_both.spec  R.
