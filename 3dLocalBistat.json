The correspondence between the dataset xyz axes and the actual spatial orientation can be determined by using program 3dinfo. ** A negative value for 'a' means that the region extends plus-and-minus abs(a) voxels in the x-direction, rather than plus-and-minus a mm. Mutatis mutandum for negative 'b' and/or 'c'. * 'RHDD(r)' is a rhombic dodecahedron of 'radius' r. * 'TOHD(r)' is a truncated octahedron of 'radius' r.",
