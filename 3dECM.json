You can control this value by setting environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to some smaller value (including 1). * Un-setting OMP_NUM_THREADS resets OpenMP back to its default state of using all CPUs available. ++ However, on some systems, it seems to be necessary to set variable OMP_NUM_THREADS explicitly, or you only get one CPU. ++ On other systems with many CPUS, you probably want to limit the CPU count, since using more than (say) 16 threads is probably useless. * You must set OMP_NUM_THREADS in the shell BEFORE running the program, since OpenMP queries this variable BEFORE the program actually starts. ++ You can't usefully set this variable in your ~/.afnirc file or on the command line with the '-D' option. * How many threads are useful? That varies with the program, and how well it was coded. You'll have to experiment on your own systems! * The number of CPUs on this particular computer system is ...... 4. * The maximum number of CPUs that will be used is now set to .... 4. =========================================================================  ++ Compile date = Sep  7 2018 {:}",
