CJV is (sigma_GM+sigma_WM)/(mean_WM-mean_GM), and is a different, ad hoc, measurement of how much the two PDF overlap. * The fitted PDFs are NOT Gaussians.  They are of the form f(x) = b((x-p)/w,a), where p=location of peak, w=width, 'a' is a skewness parameter between -1 and 1; the basic distribution is defined by b(x)=(1-x^2)^2*(1+a*x*abs(x)) for -1 < x < 1.  -- RWCox - November 2004  ++ Compile date = Sep  7 2018 {:}",
