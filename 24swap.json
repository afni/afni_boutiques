            "description": "-pattern pat  'pat' determines the pattern of 2 and 4 byte swaps.  Each element is of the form 2xN or 4xN, where N is the number of bytes to swap as pairs (for 2x) or as quadruples (for 4x).  For 2x, N must be divisible by 2; for 4x, N must be divisible by 4.  The whole pattern is made up of elements separated by colons, as in '-pattern 4x39984:2x0'.  If bytes are left over after the pattern is used up, the pattern starts over.  However, if a byte count N is zero, as in the example below, then it means to continue until the end of file.  N.B.: You can also use 1xN as a pattern, indicating to skip N bytes without any swapping. N.B.: A default pattern can be stored in the Unix environment variable AFNI_24SWAP_PATTERN. If no -pattern option is given, the default will be used.  If there is no default, then nothing will be done. N.B.: If there are bytes 'left over' at the end of the file, they are written out unswapped.  This will happen if the file is an odd number of bytes long. N.B.: If you just want to swap pairs, see program 2swap. For quadruples only, see program 4swap. N.B.: This program will overwrite the input file! You might want to test it first.  Example: 24swap -pat 4x8:2x0 fred If fred contains 'abcdabcdabcdabcdabcd' on input, then fred has    'dcbadcbabadcbadcbadc' on output.",
