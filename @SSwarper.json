Oh, what a time it is to be alive.  A current list includes:  + MNI152_2009_template_SSW.nii.gz + TT_N27_SSW.nii.gz + HaskinsPeds_NL_template1.0_SSW.nii.gz  Some of these are distributed with the AFNI binaries, and other may be found online. You can make other reference base templates in whatever space you prefer, but note that it must have several subvolumes of information included-- see NOTES on the 'The Template Dataset', below (which also contains a link to the @SSwarper template tutorial online help).  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------  OUTPUTS ~1~  Suppose the -prefix is 'sub007' (because you scanned Bond, JamesBond?). Then the outputs from this script will be\"  anatU.sub007.nii        = intensity uniform-ized original dataset; anatS.sub007.nii        = first pass skull-stripped original dataset; anatSS.sub007.nii       = second pass skull-stripped original dataset; anatQQ.sub007.nii       = skull-stripped dataset nonlinearly warped to the base template space; anatQQ.sub007.aff12.1D  = affine matrix to transform original dataset to base template space; anatQQ.sub007_WARP.nii  = incremental warp from affine transformation to nonlinearly aligned dataset; AMsub007.jpg            = 3x3 snapshot image of the anatQQ.sub007.nii dataset with the edges from the base template overlaid -- to check the alignment; MAsub007.jpg            = similar to the above, with the roles of the template and the anatomical datasets reversed.  * The .aff12.1D and _WARP.nii transformations need to be catenated to get the full warp from orginal space to the base space; example: 3dNwarpApply -nwarp 'anatQQ.sub007_WARP.nii anatQQ.sub007.aff12.1D' ...  * It is important to examine (at least) the two .jpg snapshot images to make sure that the skull-stripping and nonlinear warping worked well.  * The inputs needed for the '-tlrc_NL_warped_dsets' option to afni_proc.py are (in this order): anatQQ.sub007.nii anatQQ.sub007.aff12.1D anatQQ.sub007_WARP.nii  * When B-O-B uses this script for skull-stripping plus warping, He gives afni_proc.py these options (among others), after running @SSwarper successfully -- here, 'subj' is the subject identifier:  |  set btemplate = MNI152_2009_template_SSW.nii.gz |  set tpath = `@FindAfniDsetPath ${btemplate}` |  if( \"$tpath\" == \"\" ) exit 1 | |  afni_proc.py                                                  \\ |    [...other stuff here: processing blocks, options...]        \\ |    -copy_anat anatSS.${subj}.nii                               \\ |    -anat_has_skull no                                          \\ |    -align_opts_aea -ginormous_move -deoblique on -cost lpc+ZZ  \\ |    -volreg_align_to MIN_OUTLIER                                \\ |    -volreg_align_e2a                                           \\ |    -volreg_tlrc_warp -tlrc_base $tpath/$btemplate              \\ |    -tlrc_NL_warp                                               \\ |    -tlrc_NL_warped_dsets                                       \\ |       anatQQ.${subj}.nii                                       \\ |       anatQQ.${subj}.aff12.1D                                  \\ |       anatQQ.${subj}_WARP.nii  # -------------------------------------------------------------------  NOTES ~1~  + The Template dataset ~2~  Any reference base template dataset, such as MNI152_2009_template_SSW.nii.gz, must have the first *4* volumes here (and can have the optional 5th for later uses, as described): [0] = skull-stripped template brain volume [1] = skull-on template brain volume [2] = weight mask for nonlinear registration, with the brain given greater weight than the skull [3] = binary mask for the brain [4] = binary mask for gray matter plus some CSF (slightly dilated) ++ this volume is not used in this script ++ it is intended for use in restricting FMRI analyses to the 'interesting' parts of the brain ++ this mask should be resampled to your EPI spatial resolution (see program 3dfractionize), and then combined with a mask from your experiment reflecting your EPI brain coverage (see program 3dmask_tool).  More information about making these (with scripts) is provided on the Interweb: https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/htmldoc/template_atlas/sswarper_base.html  + You Know My Methods, Watson ~2~  #1: Uniform-ize the input dataset's intensity via 3dUnifize. ==> anatU.sub007.nii #2: Strip the skull with 3dSkullStrip, with mildly agressive settings. ==> anatS.sub007.nii #3: Nonlinearly warp (3dQwarp) the result from #1 to the skull-on template, driving the warping to a medium level of refinement. #4: Use a slightly dilated brain mask from the template to crop off the non-brain tissue resulting from #3 (3dcalc). #5: Warp the output of #4 back to original anatomical space, along with the template brain mask, and combine those with the output of #2 to get a better skull-stripped result in original space (3dNwarpApply and 3dcalc). ==> anatSS.sub007.nii #6  Restart the nonlinear warping, registering the output of #5 to the skull-off template brain volume (3dQwarp). ==> anatQQ.sub007.nii (et cetera) #7  Use @snapshot_volreg3 to make the pretty pictures. ==> AMsub007.jpg and MAsub007.jpg  + Temporary files  If the script crashes for some reason, it might leave behind files whose names start with 'junk.SSwarper' -- you should delete these files manually.  # ------------------------------------------------------- Author: Bob, Bob, there is one Bob, He spells it B-O-B. # -------------------------------------------------------",
