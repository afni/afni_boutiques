The 1D file can have leading columns for labels that will be used in the output. Label rows must be commented with the # symbol If using any of the model search options, the theta file should have a '1' for each required coefficient, '0' for each excluded coefficient, '2' for an optional coefficient. Excluded coefficients are not modeled. Required coefficients are included in every computed model.  N.B. - Connection directionality in the path connection matrices is from column to row of the output connection coefficient matrices.  Be very careful when interpreting those path coefficients. First of all, they are not correlation coefficients. Suppose we have a network with a path connecting from region A to region B. The meaning of the coefficient theta (e.g., 0.81) is this: if region A increases by one standard deviation from its mean, region B would be expected to increase by 0.81 its own standard deviations from its own mean while holding all other relevant regional connections constant. With a path coefficient of -0.16, when region A increases by one standard deviation from its mean, region B would be expected to decrease by 0.16 its own standard deviations from its own mean while holding all other relevant regional connections constant.  So theoretically speaking the range of the path coefficients can be anything, but most of the time they range from -1 to 1. To save running time, the default values for -limits are set with -1 and 1, but if the result hits the boundary, increase them and re-run the analysis.
