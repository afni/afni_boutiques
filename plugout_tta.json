To sort this out, the titlebars now show the number of the bloc of ports they are using. When the bloc is set either via environment variables AFNI_PORT_OFFSET or AFNI_PORT_BLOC, or with one of the -np* options, window title bars change from [A] to [A#] with # being the resultant bloc number. In the examples above, both AFNI and SUMA windows will show [A2] when -npb is 2.",
